🌬️ BadeHava_UI — Frontend for the “Air Talk” Chat App

“Bade Hava” (باد هوا) in Farsi means “air talk” or “wind talk” — words that drift away and vanish.
That’s exactly how this chat works: live, ephemeral, real-time.

This is the frontend implementation of the BadeHava concept — a UI built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, powered by Vite.
It connects to the backend API to enable real-time, no-history chatting.
